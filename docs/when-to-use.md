# When to Use Each Command

Quick reference for matching your situation to the right wisdom framework.

## Decision Matrix

| Your Situation | Best Command | Why |
|----------------|--------------|-----|
| "I'm anxious about an outcome" | `/wisdom-stoic-dichotomy` | Separate what you control from what you don't |
| "I need to make a big decision" | `/wisdom-cognitive-bias-scan` | Check for thinking errors first |
| "I don't know what I really think" | `/wisdom-clarify` | Socratic questioning reveals assumptions |
| "I'm not sure which framework applies" | `/wisdom-ground` | Auto-selects relevant tradition |
| "I feel scattered and reactive" | `/wisdom-mindful-pause` (Phase 2) | Create space before deciding |
| "Is this the right time to act?" | `/wisdom-strategic-timing` (Phase 2) | Assess readiness and conditions |

## By Emotional State

### Feeling Anxious
**Try:** `/wisdom-stoic-dichotomy`
- Anxiety often comes from trying to control the uncontrollable
- Focusing only on what's up to you reduces overwhelm

### Feeling Certain (Too Certain?)
**Try:** `/wisdom-cognitive-bias-scan`
- Overconfidence is a common bias
- What evidence would change your mind?

### Feeling Confused
**Try:** `/wisdom-clarify`
- Often we haven't defined our terms clearly
- Confusion may hide unexamined assumptions

### Feeling Rushed
**Try:** `/wisdom-mindful-pause` (Phase 2)
- Urgency is often manufactured
- A few minutes of clarity saves hours of fixing

### Feeling Stuck
**Try:** `/wisdom-strategic-stance` (Phase 2)
- Sometimes the issue is positioning, not effort
- Where you stand determines what's possible

## By Decision Type

### Career Decisions
1. `/wisdom-cognitive-bias-scan` - Check for sunk cost, status quo bias
2. `/wisdom-stoic-dichotomy` - What do you actually control?
3. `/wisdom-strategic-timing` (Phase 2) - Is this the right moment?

### Relationship Decisions
1. `/wisdom-clarify` - What do you actually want?
2. `/wisdom-mindful-pause` (Phase 2) - What does your gut say?
3. `/wisdom-stoic-dichotomy` - You can't control them, only yourself

### Business/Strategy Decisions
1. `/wisdom-cognitive-bias-scan` - Confirmation bias is rampant
2. `/wisdom-strategic-five-rings` (Phase 2) - Position, timing, approach
3. `/wisdom-stoic-premeditation` (Phase 2) - What if it fails completely?

### Creative Decisions
1. `/wisdom-mindful-clarity` (Phase 2) - Is your thinking clear or cluttered?
2. `/wisdom-clarify` - What are you actually trying to create?
3. `/wisdom-cognitive-bias-scan` - Are you avoiding risk unnecessarily?

### Conflict/Competition
1. `/wisdom-strategic-five-rings` (Phase 2) - Know yourself and adversary
2. `/wisdom-stoic-dichotomy` - Focus only on your actions
3. `/wisdom-cognitive-bias-scan` - Attribution errors are common

## Quick Picks

**Default starting point:** `/wisdom-ground [situation]`
- This auto-selects the most relevant framework

**When you don't have much time:** `/wisdom-stoic-dichotomy`
- Almost always useful, takes 2 minutes

**When the stakes are high:** `/wisdom-cognitive-bias-scan`
- Don't make important decisions on biased thinking

**When you need perspective:** `/wisdom-stoic-memento-mori` (Phase 2)
- Would this matter on your deathbed?

## Combining Commands

For important decisions, consider running multiple commands:

```
1. /wisdom-clarify [decision] - Make sure terms are clear
2. /wisdom-cognitive-bias-scan [reasoning] - Check for errors
3. /wisdom-stoic-dichotomy [situation] - Focus on controllables
4. /wisdom-strategic-timing [action] - Is now the right time?
```

The `/wisdom-ground` command does a lighter version of this automatically.
