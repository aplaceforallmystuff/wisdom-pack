- Almost always useful, takes 2 minutes

**When the stakes are high:** `/wisdom-cognitive-bias-scan`
- Don't make important decisions on biased thinking

**When you need perspective:** `/wisdom-stoic-memento-mori`
- Would this matter on your deathbed?

**When facing fear:** `/wisdom-stoic-premeditation`
- Face it fully to take away its power

**When timing matters:** `/wisdom-strategic-timing`

## Combining Commands

For important decisions, consider running multiple commands:

```
1. /wisdom-clarify [decision] - Make sure terms are clear
2. /wisdom-cognitive-bias-scan [reasoning] - Check for errors
3. /wisdom-stoic-dichotomy [situation] - Focus on controllables
4. /wisdom-strategic-timing [action] - Is now the right time?
5. /wisdom-stoic-premeditation [plan] - What if it fails?
```

The `/wisdom-ground` command does a lighter version of this automatically.
