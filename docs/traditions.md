# Philosophical Traditions

wisdom-pack draws from four major traditions, each offering distinct lenses for examining decisions and situations.

## Stoicism

**Origin:** Ancient Greece/Rome (3rd century BCE - 2nd century CE)
**Key Figures:** Epictetus, Marcus Aurelius, Seneca

### Core Principles

1. **Dichotomy of Control** - Some things are up to us (our judgments, desires, actions), others are not (external events, other people, outcomes)

2. **Virtue as the Only Good** - The only true good is living virtuously; everything else is a "preferred indifferent"

3. **Living According to Nature** - Accept the natural order, including impermanence and adversity

4. **Negative Visualization** - Regularly contemplate loss to appreciate what you have and prepare for challenges

### When to Use
- Facing anxiety about outcomes you can't control
- Needing emotional resilience
- Processing disappointment or setback
- Making decisions under uncertainty

### Commands
- `/wisdom:stoic:dichotomy` - Separate controllable from uncontrollable
- `/wisdom:stoic:premeditation` - Visualize worst case scenarios
- `/wisdom:stoic:memento-mori` - Mortality perspective
- `/wisdom:stoic:virtue` - Virtue ethics check

## Cognitive Science

**Origin:** 20th-21st century psychology
**Key Figures:** Daniel Kahneman, Amos Tversky, Richard Thaler

### Core Principles

1. **System 1 and System 2** - Fast, automatic thinking vs. slow, deliberate thinking

2. **Cognitive Biases** - Systematic errors in thinking that affect decisions

3. **Heuristics** - Mental shortcuts that usually work but can mislead

4. **Bounded Rationality** - Human reasoning has limits; we satisfice rather than optimize

### Common Biases
- **Confirmation bias** - Seeking info that confirms beliefs
- **Availability heuristic** - Overweighting easily recalled examples
- **Anchoring** - Over-relying on first information received
- **Sunk cost fallacy** - Continuing because of past investment
- **Loss aversion** - Losses hurt more than gains feel good

### When to Use
- Making important decisions
- Evaluating evidence or arguments
- Noticing emotional reactions to information
- Checking your own reasoning

### Commands
- `/wisdom:cognitive:bias-scan` - Detect cognitive biases
- `/wisdom:cognitive:system-check` - Identify fast vs slow thinking
- `/wisdom:cognitive:heuristics` - Identify mental shortcuts

## Mindfulness

**Origin:** Buddhist traditions, secularized for modern practice
**Key Figures:** Sharon Salzberg, Thich Nhat Hanh, Jon Kabat-Zinn

### Core Principles

1. **Present-Moment Awareness** - Attention to what's happening now, not past or future

2. **Non-Judgmental Observation** - Notice without labeling good/bad

3. **Impermanence** - All experiences are temporary and changing

4. **Beginner's Mind** - Approach each moment fresh, without assumptions

### When to Use

## Strategic Thinking

**Origin:** Eastern martial and strategic traditions
**Key Figures:** Miyamoto Musashi, Sun Tzu

### Core Principles

1. **Know Yourself and Your Enemy** - Understanding is prerequisite to strategy

2. **Timing** - The right action at the wrong time fails

3. **Positioning** - Where you stand determines what's possible

4. **Economy of Action** - Do only what's necessary, no more

### The Five Rings (Musashi)
- **Earth** - Foundation, basics, groundwork
- **Water** - Adaptability, flexibility
- **Fire** - Speed, aggression when needed
- **Wind** - Understanding others' approaches
- **Void** - Transcendence, no-mind

### When to Use
- Competitive situations
- Timing important actions
- Dealing with adversaries
- Planning complex endeavors

### Commands
- `/wisdom:strategic:five-rings` - Apply Musashi's principles
- `/wisdom:strategic:timing` - Assess readiness for action
- `/wisdom:strategic:stance` - Evaluate positioning

## Using Multiple Traditions

Complex situations often benefit from multiple frameworks:

**Example: Career Decision**
1. **Cognitive** - Check for biases (sunk cost in current job? availability bias from recent stories?)
2. **Stoic** - What's actually in your control?
3. **Mindful** - What does your gut say when you sit with it?
4. **Strategic** - What's the timing? What's your positioning?

The `/wisdom:ground` command automatically suggests relevant traditions for your situation.
